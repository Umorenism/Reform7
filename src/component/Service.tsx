              We are followers of Jesus Christ, anointed and consumed with the
              passion of the Holy Spirit in love and grace, to see Africa become
              the people God has purposed her to be, by raising reformers that
              are passionate, focused, and very courageous to influence society
              everyday by walking in their God-driven purposes outside (and
              within) the four walls of the church. We are not religious;
              rather, through our intimate relationship with God, we are able to
              influence our society with the same influence we receive from God.
              We are rebuilders, restorersâ€¦ REFORMERS!
